# ShaderTests
****
This is a Unity project with several examples (normally small tests) primary based on uses and creation of Shaders.
Also I will follow different tutorials from http://catlikecoding.com to test.

You are welcome to read and ask anything in the code.

Enjoy yourself,

Daniel Goldaraz
